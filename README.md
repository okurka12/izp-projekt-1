# IZP - First project
Here is my previously private repo of my solution of the first project in **Introduction to programming systems (IZP)** class, which is basically an introductory C course and introduction to programming as a whole.  I coded it in late october of 2022, when I took the class.

I tried to apply all the best manners from my previous Python experience and I think I did not do the worst job, being a beginner in C.

I refused to use `string.h` even though I was not at all forbidden to do so. Also I only used getchar() to load input from stdin, it was just a little challenge I gave myself. Seems like I was being a masochist.

I am now publishing this repo so that I have something to show on my GitHub profile.
